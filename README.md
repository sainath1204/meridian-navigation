# Meridian Navigation

Workspace navigation and content handoff.

Part of the Meridian document workspace. Configuration is supplied through environment variables. SERVICE_KEY authenticates internal requests. The edge resolves sessions through accounts and forwards X-User-Id and X-Tenant-Id to downstream services. Internal services are reachable only on the application network.
